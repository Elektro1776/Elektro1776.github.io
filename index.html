              <p>
                Howdy folks! My name is Austin Reynolds.
                Born and raised in Colorado and currently at the age bracket to rent a car!!(beep beep).
              </p>
              <p>  I have been writing code for about 3+ years off and on, with really getting my hands dirty just the last year.
                My biggest language base is most likely Javascript. The last 3 projects I have written have been in React-Native.
                Which if you don't know is <strong>TIGHT!</strong>  With that said I have a decent understanding of HTML5, Css3,
                Javascript(oldScool ES5) and Been digging on the ES6 as of late.
                My ultimate goal with technology is to build something that helps this place we all call <strong>HOME.</strong>
                I figure getting my foot in the door with all things code for the web it will probably come in handy down the road.
              </p>
              <p>
                The biggest challenge in technology, that I see anyways, is the integration of hardware to software to userExperience. And now with
                web driven and mobile application integration exponetially growing e.g. " IoT ", making sure that a users experience is the best as possible
                you have got to know the web to deliver the best experience possible!
              </p>
              <p>
                Moving past my code life and goal, really I enjoy playing Gutiar, contemplating the cosmos, trying to become
                more like Sherlock Holmes, sitting on Mtns, going to concerts, cloud watching, wathching the shadows of clouds float across the ground.
                You know just live :) So please feel free to contact me if you want to talk code, or just go sit on a mtn and shoot the breeeze!
